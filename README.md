#### Overview:
The heavy traffic congestion in Nairobi is a significant challenge for commuters, bus operators, and ticketing agencies. To address this problem, a predictive model has been developed to forecast the number of tickets that will be sold for buses traveling into Nairobi from upcountry in Kenya. This model is based on traffic data from Uber Movement and historic bus ticket sales data from Mobiticket. By accurately predicting customer demand, bus operators and Mobiticket can allocate resources more efficiently, reducing congestion on the roads and improving the overall commuting experience.

#### Objective:
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately forecast the number of tickets that will be sold for buses traveling into Nairobi from upcountry in Kenya. The model is based on traffic data from Uber Movement and historic bus ticket sales data from Mobiticket. By accurately predicting customer demand, bus operators and Mobiticket can allocate resources more efficiently, reducing congestion on the roads and improving the overall commuting experience.

#### Data Description:
The dataset used for analysis and model building was obtained from Uber Movement and is in a CSV format. It includes several variables, such as ride ID, seat number, payment method, payment receipt, travel date, travel time, travel from, travel to, car type, and max capacity. The data has been preprocessed to remove any missing values and outliers.

#### Methodology:
The predictive model was developed using a machine learning approach. First, exploratory data analysis was performed to gain insights into the data and identify any trends or patterns. Then, the data was split into training and testing sets, and various machine learning algorithms were applied, including linear regression, decision tree, random forest, neural network and gradient boosting. The performance of each algorithm was evaluated using metrics such as mean squared error and R-squared. The best performing algorithm was then selected for final model development.

#### Results:
